# AIFaceDetectionProyect
This is my final project for the subject of Artificial Intelligence.
The theme of this project is an app using artificial intelligence for face detection in both photos and video on the Google Colab platform.

To run the program you can only use the Open Colab button within the project as well as make a "git clone" within your Google Colab

enjoy it!
